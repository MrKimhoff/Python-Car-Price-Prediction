# Used Car Price Prediction

This project was a requirement for one of my classes during my Master's Data Science program at Bellevue Univeristy.

#### -- Project Status: `In-Progress`

## Project Intro/Objective
The primary purpose of this project is to train a predictive analytics model utlizing a used car dataset. The trained model would be provided to prospective car buying customers so that they would have a better understanding of the prices they should be paying based on the desired characteristics of the vehicle they want.
